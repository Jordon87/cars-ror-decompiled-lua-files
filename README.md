# Cars: Race-O-Rama decompiled lua files.
This is a repo containing all of decompiled Race-O-Rama lua files, taken from the Xbox 360 version of the game. Wouldn't be possible without the unluac program.

The decompilation here is a bit rough, it isn't 100% accurate, and most of it won't work if you mod the game.
